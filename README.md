# Solar-System-Simulation
Solar System Simulation ðŸŒŒ A dynamic 3D simulation of the solar system built using OpenGL and C++.

Features:
Frame Rate Limitation: Smooth execution limited to 60 frames per second.
Comprehensive Celestial Objects:
Includes the Sun, all planets (including dwarf planets), moons, and three asteroid belts.
Each planet has accurate representations (e.g., Saturn with its rings).
Object Interactivity:
Hover over objects to display their name at the bottom of the screen.
Click on objects to display detailed information, including:
Name, mass, size, type, and a random fun fact (trivia).
Realistic Motion:
Planets move in correct orbits and speeds.
Planets also rotate on their axes.
Uses GLM library and transformations for accurate modeling.
Orbit Visibility:
Toggle planet orbits on/off using the keyboard.
Simulation Controls:
Adjust simulation speed using hotkeys.
Pause/resume the simulation as needed.
